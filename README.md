# ImageSearchEngineContentbased


The objective of this project is to implement a content-based image search engine, which enables the retrieval of images most similar to a query image within a database. An image search engine
comprises two main components:

* Indexing, which involves defining an automatic method to describe images, enabling their differentiation[based on the histogram and the texture]

* Searching, where users have a means to search for query images within an image database.

# To run the code 

1. Clone the project

2. execute : python interface.py

# Explication 

1. The first interface [Route: /index] will let you enter the desireb number of columns and rows to show images from the database(Note: the database contains 50 image)

2. The second interface [Route: /show_images] will show the images

3. Tap on the desired image to show top 4 similar images

4. Now top 4 images are occured with similarity distance calculated
